# chromoception
 * Introduction
 Welcome to CHROMOCEPTION! Chromoception is a game designed to aid with mood management, specifically with depression. Throughout the game, you will make your way down a path that is designed to mediate your moods. The ambient lighting of the game will change as you go through the maze, going through a specific sequence of colors: #0944a1ff --> #cfe2f3ff --> #d392ffff --> #d5a6bdff --> #f9cb9cff --> #f6b26bff.
 At the end of this sequence, you will play a relaxing game of Cube Run, where the color theme is the same as the final color in the sequence. You will navigate a contantly moving cube along a path around obstacles. If you fail, don't worry! You can try again enless times. The absence of scores or rankings creates a stress-free environment for the player. Cube Run consists of three levels of increasing difficulty, and then Chromoception is finished!
